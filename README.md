FullStack JS Developer
----------------------

I've been coding for almost a year now, I love to workout, play my saxophone, and learn about coding + business! I love the detailed art of frontend development and the systematic beauty of creating a backend. I love to problem solve and systemitize/automate solutions. My favorite part of software development is seeing how my development skills transfer to the bigger picture of a business.
