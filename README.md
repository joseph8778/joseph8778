FullStack JS Developer
----------------------

I’ve been coding for almost a year now. I specialize in the detailed craft of frontend development and the systematic beauty of building backends with JavaScript. I love working out, playing my saxophone, and diving into both coding and business! I’m passionate about problem-solving and creating automated, streamlined solutions. My favorite part of software development is seeing how my skills tie into the bigger picture of a business.
